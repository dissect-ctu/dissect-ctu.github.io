**DISsecT** is a [CTF](https://medium.com/@DRX_Sicher/ctf-explained-6c7d4417305e) team at [FIT CTU](https://www.fit.cvut.cz/en) in Prague. The team was set up over the summer of 2019 by students who desired to participate in Capture The Flag(CTF) competitions together. We believe that these kinds of competitions offer a great way to learn and practice IT security skills.

DISsecT operates under patronage of [Department of Information Security](https://www.fit.cvut.cz/en/dis), and thus we meet in room TH:A-957 (Ethical Hacking Lab) at the faculty.

At these pages you can find announcements, news and blog posts covering various topics. We have a desire to write posts e.g. about interesting challenges we encounter in CTFs or in the real world. To gather all of our write-ups and data about how we did in CTF competitions, we decided to maintain a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dissect-ctu/ctfs).

A history on participated competitions can also be found on [CTFtime page](https://ctftime.org/team/80103).

Thanks for reading!
