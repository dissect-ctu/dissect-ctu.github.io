### Who we are

[**DIS**](https://www.fit.cvut.cz/en/dis) **sec**urity **T**eam was set up over the summer of 2019 by students who desired to participate in Capture The Flag ([CTF](https://medium.com/@DRX_Sicher/ctf-explained-6c7d4417305e)) competitions together. Current **DISsecT** members are all enrolled in the Computer Security study programme at [**DIS**](https://www.fit.cvut.cz/en/dis), and thus we operate at the soil of this Department.

### What we do

The primary purpose of **DISsecT** is to participate in CTF competitions and learn together. We believe that these kinds of competitions offer a great way to learn and practice IT security skills. At these pages, you can find announcements, news and blog posts covering various topics. We have a desire to write posts, e.g. about exciting challenges we encounter in CTFs or in the real world.

### How to reach us

If you wish to leave us a message, please use our [twitter](https://twitter.com/DissectC) profile.
To gather all of our write-ups and data about how we did in CTF competitions, we decided to maintain a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dissect-ctu/ctfs).
A history on participated competitions can also be found on [CTFtime page](https://ctftime.org/team/80103).

Thanks for reading!
