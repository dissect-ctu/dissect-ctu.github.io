On the 14th of November 2019, we took part in a [ctf](https://ctf.accenture.com) competition organised by Accenture. A Team consisting of `ivanivlee`, `h4vry`, `TheLonePiper` and `ordbl0ke` rose to the occasion and finished **third** in the late dramatic finale!

#### More

The competition required the contestants to be students and limited the team size to 4. This was unfortunate as **DISsecT** has more than 4 members, thus we had to split the team into two. The team of `ivanivlee`, `h4vry`, `TheLonePiper` and `ordbl0ke` benefited from having 4 participants and successfully grabbed a podium spot. The team that contested from a different, remote location to prevent inter-team cooperation, combined the efforts of `gorei` and `hrdel`. They fell short to the numbers, but ended up on a solid, 11th spot, leaving more than two thirds of the contesting teams behind.
