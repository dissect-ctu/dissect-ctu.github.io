  HOW TO
  ======
  1. copy this template and change its name
  2. change front matter (at the top between the triple dashes)
   - title, date matching the file name + current time, and authors nickname (choose from `_data/members.yml`)
   - remove `published: false`
  3. write your awesome post
   - use Markdown syntax - https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet
   - don't forget to **use the excerpt** - separates the first interesting part that goes to the Home page from the rest of the long post
   - the separator is the line between *This will be shown..* and *This won't..*
   - replace the *This will be shown..* and *This won't..* placeholders with an actual content
  4. delete this comment section
{% endcomment %}

*This will be shown in the preview on the main page.*
