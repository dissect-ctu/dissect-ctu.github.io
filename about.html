  DISsecT is a <a href="https://">CTF</a> team at <a href="https://www.fit.cvut.cz/en">FIT CTU</a> in Prague. The team was set up over the summer
  of 2019 by students who desired to participate in CTF competitions together. We believe that these kinds of competitions are a great way to 
  learn and practice IT security skills.
</p>
<p>

  DISsecT operates under patronage of <a href="https://www.fit.cvut.cz/en/dis">Department of Information Security</a>, and thus we meet in room
  TH:A-957 (Ethical Hacking Lab) at the faculty.

<p>
  At these pages you can find announcements, news and blog posts covering various topics. 
  We have a desire to write posts e.g. about interesting challenges we encounter in CTFs or in the real world. To gather all of our write-ups and
  data about how we did in CTF competitions, we decided to maintain github 
  <a href="https://github.com/dissect-ctu/ctfs"><i class="fa fa-github"></i> repository</a>.
  <br/>
  A history on participated competitions can also be found on <a href="https://ctftime.org/team/80103">ctftime</a> page.
