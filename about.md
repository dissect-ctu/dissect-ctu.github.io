## DISsecT@CTU

Hello and welcome to pages of DISsecT, which stands for [DIS](https://www.fit.cvut.cz/en/dis) SECurity Team. We are a bunch of enthusiastic cyber security students at [FIT CTU](https://www.fit.cvut.cz/en) under patronage of [Department of Information Security](https://www.fit.cvut.cz/en/dis). We meet up to compete in [CTF](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/) competitions together.

At these pages you can find announcements, basic information about us and various blogposts. You can find write ups from CTF competitions in our dedicated github [repository](https://github.com/dissect-ctu/ctfs)

Thanks for reading!
